/*
 * Declaration of a generic graph for the "Datastructures and
 * algorithms" courses at the Department of Computing Science, Umea
 * University. The graph stores nodes and edges of a directed or
 * undirected graph. After use, the function graph_kill() must
 * be called to de-allocate the dynamic memory used by the graph
 * itself. The de-allocation of any dynamic memory allocated for the
 * node names is the responsibility of the user of the graph.

 * Version information:
 *   v1.0  2019-02-21: First public version.

 *   v1.01 2019-02-26: Modified include directives for header files
 *                     from the codebase to use "" to handle case when
 *                     student stores all header files in the current
 *                     directory. See
 *                     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21593/what-is-the-difference-between-include-filename-and-include-filename.
 *   v1.02 2019-03-01: Doc update in graph_node_is_seen().
 *   v1.1  2019-03-06: Changed several const node * to node *.
 *                     Fixed doc bug to state that any dynamic memory allocated
 *                     to the node NAMES is the resposibility of the user.
